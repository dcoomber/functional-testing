# Functional testing using tools
Likely to be a dump of whatever functional testing tools I experiment with... time will tell.

## Karate
Karate is the only open-source tool to combine API test-automation, mocks and performance-testing into a single, unified framework. The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers. Besides powerful JSON & XML assertions, you can run tests in parallel for speed - which is critical for HTTP API testing.

Go [here](karate/README.md) for more details.

## API

### Postman
Postman is the collaboration platform for API development. Postman simplifies each step of building an API and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.

Go [here](api-postman/README.md) for more details.

### Bruno
Bruno is a Fast and Git-Friendly Opensource API client. Bruno stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem. We use a plain text markup language, Bru, to save information about API requests.

Go [here](api-bruno/README.md) for more details.

## Robot Framework
Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development. It is a keyword-driven testing framework that uses tabular test data syntax.

My initial exploration with Robot Framework came to an abrupt end... and now the scripts I created no longer work.  *sigh* I'll focuse on this one more in the future.

Go [here](robotframework/README.md) for more details.
